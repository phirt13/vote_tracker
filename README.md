vote_tracker

This is a voting app that tracks the cuteness votes of 14 kitties.

2 kitties are displayed each round and the user is asked to click on the kitty image that they find cutest.

The kitties are stored in two arrays: one with the first 7 kitties; another with the second 7 kitties.
This prevents two of the same kitties from being displayed in the same round.

Each time a user votes for a kitty the vote is added to the total votes of that kitty.

A graph which displays the amount of total votes for each kitty changes as each kitty acquires more votes.
